## Data Science: Probability
Probability theory is the mathematical foundation of statistical inference which is indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists. In this course, you will learn important concepts in probability theory. The motivation for this course is the circumstances surrounding the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Part of what caused this financial crisis was that the risk of certain securities sold by financial institutions was underestimated. To begin to understand this very complicated event, we need to understand the basics of probability. We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing are likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance. Statistical inference, covered in the next course in this series, builds upon probability theory.

#### In this course, you will learn:
* Important concepts in probability theory including random variables and independence
* How to perform a Monte Carlo simulation
* The meaning of expected values and standard errors and how to compute them in R
* The importance of the Central Limit Theorem

## Course Overview
#### Section 1: Discrete Probability
You will learn about basic principles of probability related to categorical data using card games as examples.
#### Section 2: Continuous Probability
You will learn about basic principles of probability related to numeric and continuous data.
#### Section 3: Random Variables, Sampling Models, and The Central Limit Theorem
You will learn about random variables (numeric outcomes resulting from random processes), how to model data generation procedures as draws from an urn, and the Central Limit Theorem, which applies to large sample sizes.
#### Section 4: The Big Short
You will learn how interest rates are determined and how some bad assumptions led to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
