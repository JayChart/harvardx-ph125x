# Properties of Stars Exercises


## Background
Astronomy is one of the oldest data-driven sciences. In the late 1800s, the director of the Harvard College Observatory hired women to analyze astronomical data, which at the time was done using photographic glass plates. These women became known as the “Harvard Computers”. They computed the position and luminosity of various astronomical objects such as stars and galaxies. (If you are interested, you can learn more about the Harvard Computers). Today, astronomy is even more of a data-driven science, with an inordinate amount of data being produced by modern instruments every day.

In the following exercises we will analyze some actual astronomical data to inspect properties of stars, their absolute magnitude (which relates to a star's luminosity, or brightness), temperature and type (spectral class).
