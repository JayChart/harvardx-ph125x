# Climate Change Exercises

### Background
The planet's surface temperature is increasing due to human greenhouse gas emissions, and this global warming and carbon cycle disruption is wreaking havoc on natural systems. Living systems that depend on current temperature, weather, currents and carbon balance are jeopardized, and human society will be forced to contend with widespread economic, social, political and environmental damage as the temperature continues to rise. Although most countries recognize that global warming is a crisis and that humans must act to limit its effects, little action has been taken to limit or reverse human impact on the climate.

One limitation is the spread of misinformation related to climate change and its causes, especially the extent to which humans have contributed to global warming. In these exercises, we examine the relationship between global temperature changes, greenhouse gases and human carbon emissions using time series of actual atmospheric and ice core measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC).
