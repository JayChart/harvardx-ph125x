# HarvardX-PH125x

Everything I've learned from the HarvardX's Data Science Professional Certificate (HarvardX: PH125x). This repository contains all the codes and programming exercises I've worked on during the course.

## What we learned? 
* Fundamental R programming skills
* Statistical concepts such as probability, inference, and modeling and how to apply them in practice
* Gain experience with the tidyverse, including data visualization with ggplot2 and data wrangling with dplyr
* Become familiar with essential tools for practicing data scientists such as Unix/Linux, git and GitHub, and RStudio
* Implement machine learning algorithms
* In-depth knowledge of fundamental data science concepts through motivating real-world case studies
